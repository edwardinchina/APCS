# APCS
The goal of this class is for everyone to learn enough programming to be able to implement useful tools in a work setting. Computer programming is used in many fields such as medicine, finance, data analysis, graphic design, and automation but as AI is becoming stronger and more widespread, programming is becoming more vital as an employable skill.
